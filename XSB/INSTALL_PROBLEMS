    Known problems with the XSB installation procedure
    ==================================================

1. Linux systems using the a.out format aren't recognized automatically.
   To circumvent this, you must supply the --linuxaout option to the
   configure script. If you haven't specified --config-tag on command line,
   this will add -aout to the configuration tag, and 
   you will need to use makexsb --config-tag=-aout to compile the system.
   (You will be told which tag to use once configure is done working.)

2. On 64 bit SGI's the default mode is 32 bit, so the configure script
   might build the system for 32 bits. To force the 64 bit mode, use the
   --force64 option. This will append -bits64 to the configuration tag, and
   you will need to use makexsb --config-tag=-bits64 to compile the system.
   (--enable-debugging also automatically adds -dbg to the configuration tag.
   So, you might have to use -bits-dbg with makexsb. When configure script
   finishes, it tells you which tag to use.)

3. Installing for Windows is a whole new ball game.
   See INSTALL_WINDOWS.

4. If your system doesn't have `makedepend', you will get an error message
   when you type `makexsb', but the compilation will proceed.
   This is not a big problem, unless you make modifications to XSB and try
   to recompile it. Since the dependencies are generated automatically by
   `makedepend', your modified system may not be recompiled properly.
   The only sure way to recompile in this situation is to type:

       makexsb configclean  # delete the old object code
       makexsb

   A better way, though, it to get and install makedepend (say, from GNU).

5. The list of problems is bound to grow further.
