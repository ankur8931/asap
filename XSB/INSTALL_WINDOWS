	INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS
	--------------------------------------

There are two ways to install XSB on Windows:
      - Using CygWin emulation of POSIX system calls; and
      - A native build.

For CygWin, the installation process is the same as under Unix --- see the
./INSTALL file --- with one caveat. XSB can be built using CygWin64 and
CygWin32. However, the latter must then be installed on a 32 bit Windows
machine. XSB will not build under CygWin32 on a 64 bit Windows: if you use
Windows64 then also CygWin64 must be used.

The native build depends on how you obtained XSB:

   - checked out from the CVS repository at http://xsb.sourceforge.net
   - downloaded a pre-configured version of XSB from http://xsb.sourceforge.net

You must have a copy of Visual C++ installed in order to build XSB
natively. You can get a free (as in beer) version of VC Express from
http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/
If you don't have one (and don't feel like having it), then
your next best bet is to download a pre-compiled version of XSB from
http://xsb.sourceforge.net.

In most cases you do not need to perform steps 1 and 2 below.

1. Check the file 

       config\x86-pc-windows\xsb_config.h

   You may have to change some variables there. The variables are commented
   so hopefully it should be clear how things might need to be changed.
   The part of the file where changes are allowed is clearly marked.

2. Check the file:

       config\x86-pc-windows\lib\xsb_configuration.P

   Again, some settings there might need to be changed.
   The file is commented and the part that might need to be changed is
   clearly marked.

3. If you downloaded a pre-compiled version of XSB, you are done.
   If you need to recompile XSB, then read (6).

4. Compile the .\emu directory.

      cd build
      makexsb
      (or makexsb64 on a 64 bit machine)


[NOTES on using Microsoft Visual C++:]

To compile from the command line, you should set some environment
variables. Visual C++ has a command file called vcvars32.bat or similar,
which you should find and drag into the command window (and press Return).
This will set all the necessary environment variables. On a 64 bit machine
(BUT SEE THE XSB MANUAL FOR MORE DETAILS:
  - For VC 9.0:
    use the command file is called vcvarsx86_amd64.bat or
    vcvarsx86_ia64.bat - whichever is appropriate for your configuration.
  - For VC 10.0: 
    use SetEnv.cmd

The executable and the DLL will be in

     .\config\x86-pc-windows\bin\xsb.exe
     .\config\x86-pc-windows\bin\xsb.dll

or, for a 64 bit machine, in

     .\config\x64-pc-windows\bin\xsb.exe
     .\config\x64-pc-windows\bin\xsb.dll

5. If you compile for 32 bits and would like to recompile for 64, run

     makexsb clean

   before recompilation. Likewise, to recompile for 32 bits after
   previously compiling for 64 bits, run

     makexsb64 clean

   in-between.
