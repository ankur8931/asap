		XSB Coding Guidelines
		---------------------

1. Naming conventions (to be converted to gradually)

   a. #define constants and macros:
	  Must be prefixed with XSB_ (e.g., XSB_STRUCT).
	  Function-looking macros should be capitalized (e.g., XSB_Deref())

   b. Typedefs:
	  Must be prefixed with xsb and capitalized (e.g., xsbBool).

   c. All external function calls:
	  Must be prefixed with xsb and capitalized (e.g., xsbString_find).

   d. C interface routines, like c2p_int, p2p_arg, etc.
	  Leave as is (no prefixes).
