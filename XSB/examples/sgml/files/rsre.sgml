SGML does NOT add record start characters at the beginning or
record end characters at the end of entities unless they are
already there.  In this document, there IS a record start
character for the first line of text and there IS a record end
character for the last line of text.  The #RS character reference
should match at the beginning of each line except possibly the
first one, so we expect SEVEN (LINE) elements for this file.
